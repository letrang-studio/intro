- 👋 Hi, Hola, Servus, Chào
- 🤓 I’m Trang, a UX designer with a profound 10+ years of experiences in the Planning and Architecture industry. In 2019 I founded my own studio in Graphic Design. Over the time my practice has shifted organically to Digital Design.
- 👀 I’m a designer by heart, but very much interested in the engineering level of the virtual infrastructure. It's the same way an architect learns about the work of other sub-consultants in the built environment.
- 🌱 I’ve taught myself HTML, CSS and JS to build my own homepage. I'm also a data enthuasiast, for that I learned R, Python, SQL to upgrade my analytical skills. Currently I'm diving deeper in JS and Python as it seems you can build anything with these languages.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with developers who want a designer's perspective on their products.
- 📫 Check out my design work at www.letrang.ml. Drop me an email at letrang_studio@outlook.com if you're interested in collaborative work.
